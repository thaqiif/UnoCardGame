# UNO Card

Uno card is a simple game developed to play between you against the computer. The algorithm comes from how we play the game; the way we choose the card by either its color, number or the wild card. 

The game developed using web-languages programming which are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. When I develop this game, I arrange by priority on how computer choosing cards when it comes to computer's turn. The priorities as follow:

1. Search for the same color as on the table
2. If the card not found, it will look for the same number
3. If both above not satisfied, then the computer will check if it has a wild card. If it did, then it will throw that on the table.
4. If all above is not triggering, then it will withdraw a card. If the withdraw is match with on the table, then it will throw that.

*I'm using the word "throw" because i can't think the exact word in the time of writing. Sorry!* ðŸ¤£

## Android Mobile App
When I want to play this game (on the website), it require internet connection to load at first and every time the game is finished. So, I convert the game into mobile app with the help of [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com) which enables the conversion without the need to write another mobile-code. Just use the same code and languages, and let the PhoneGap do the magic.
